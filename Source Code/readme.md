**NOTE: Pre-compiled folder contains several required dependencies that you'll need even if you decide to compile it by yourself**

Most of these are custom gsc scripts using the new method of loading scripts.

New method: _".\.\t6r\scripts\zm" _

Old method: _".\.\t6r\data\maps\mp\gametypes_zm"_


Currently _clientids and _scoreboard should be executed the old way. 
Use _clientids(old) if you're having problems, the new method is still being worked on to be stable.
