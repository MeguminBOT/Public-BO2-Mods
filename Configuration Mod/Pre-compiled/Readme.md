# Where should I put the files?

1. _clientids.gsc should be installed to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\t6r\data\maps\mp\gametypes_zm"
2. _scoreboard.gsc should be installed to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\t6r\data\maps\mp\gametypes_zm"
3. _zm_powerups.gsc should be installed to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\t6r\data\maps\mp\zombies"
4. _zm_tomb_craftables.gsc should be installed to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\t6r\data\maps\mp"

The provided dedicated_zm.cfg file MUST be added for everything to work correctly, if you want to configure it from scratch, go to JezuzLizards Configuration Mod for a clean untouched cfg file.
* Extract dedicated_zm.cfg to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\main"
If the location above doesn't load your custom settings, try adding a copy of the dedicated_zm.cfg to "C:\pluto_t6_full_game\t6r\data". 
I'm still not sure which one of them the server reads from lol, both seems to work I think.


If the folders doesn't exist, you can just create them.
