 Public BO2 Mods For Plutonium T6

THIS IS A FORK OF https://github.com/JezuzLizard/Public-BO2-Mods/tree/master/Configuration%20Mod

Main goal of this fork is to make a mega script compilation that's easy to tweak or to help inexperienced people host their own server with ZERO scripting knowledge

Added some additional scripts, tweaked values and added more comments to the Classic Zombie gamemodes to enhance player experience without removing the BO1/BO2 zombie feeling.

Added features include (Works directly after download if downloading pre-compiled GSC and dedicated_zm.cfg files)

    HUD: Zombie Counter

    HUD: Shield Durability

    HUD: Timers showing Total Time spent and Round Time.

    HUD: Names for different locations on the map.

    HUD: Hitmarkers

    Visual: Remove FOG and Depth of Field from the map. (I personally get nauseous of these effects, if you want them then disable them inside _clientids.gsc and compile it

    Tweaks: Quick Revive gives a small boost to Health Regeneration

    Tweaks: Black Ops 4 Zombie Health values (Health doesn't increase after round 35)

NOTE: I won't add any scripts that will auto build easter egg stuff for you or grant mod menu hack commands since I consider these cheating

Future goals:
Make every script toggle-able through dedicated_zm.cfg without making the server unstable.
